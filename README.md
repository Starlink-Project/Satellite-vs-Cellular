# Satellite-vs-Cellular

## Introduction
In this work, we present a measurement study of the Starlink LEO satellite network in comparison with cellular networks, aiming to uncover the potential for synergistic integration. Through a large-scale data collection campaign and in-depth analysis, we (1) identify the performance characteristics of two Starlink configurations, (2) evaluate the coverage of the current Starlink deployment compared to major cellular carriers, and (3) investigate the potential benefits of enabling multipath using both LEO satellite and cellular networks.   

To help you easily obtain the figures and data in this paper, we provided complete scripts and processed data. We even provide detailed instructions on using the scripts and dataset. The folders and files are classified according to the order of the figures presented in the paper.
Most of the figures could be generated by just running a simple line in the terminal.
